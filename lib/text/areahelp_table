AVALON

^Gbackground^n:
Since ancient times, the fabled island of Avalon have captured the
imaginations of countless adventurers. Ancient records hint of
a place that is somehow disconnected from space and time, where
men and beasts lived in harmony, watched over by an order of
priestesses dedicated to preserving the great balance. One day,
travelers passing through Dunbar's Road noticed a small lake that had
appeared out of nowhere, and many swear they can sense something
wondering hidden behind the impenetrable fog. The most pious of
these people have already proclaimed that Avalon has returned.

^Grecommended levels^n:
The great majority of the inhabitants of Avalon are peaceful by
nature and will welcome you with open arms. Beware of the
priestesses, for they will attack anyone who dares to disrupt the
balance in Avalon. Tucked into a small corner of the island however
are menacing beasts who are too powerful for even the priestesses
to control. Thus, Avalon provides good challenge for a wide
range of players from level 5 to 35.

^Glocation^n:
Although the island of Avalon is disconnected from space and time,
the current gateway exists somewhere on the lake not too far from
Kore, near the beginning of Dunbar's Road.

"BEANSTALK CASTLE" BEANSTALK

^Gbackground^n:
Sitting impossibly in the sky above Kore, the Beanstalk Castle is
a structure shrouded with mystery and danger. Accessible only through
magic beans that grow into monstrous sky bridges, it is a mansion for
giants whose like are not found anywhere in Kore. Guarded diligently
day and night, powerful wizards and healers practice their arts, and
rumors abound of a metal beast that lurks deep within the bowels of
the mansion.

^Grecommended levels^n:
The giants of beanstalk castle are known for their mildness; it is
said that the few "little people" who enter their domain are politely
ignored by these people. However, if one of their number is
attacked, they become savage fighters capable of doing immense
damage. Levels 25 to 40 can probably survive the castle if they
are careful not to anger too many of these giants at once.

^Glocation^n:
Beantalk Castle is located in the sky somewhere above the Sylvan
Woods. The only mean of access is through magical beans hidden
somewhere on the forest floor.

"THE TEMPLE OF ORSUS" ORSUS IMIRL TIRITH

^Gbackground^n:
Not far from the great river Orsus the town named for it sits. It is
the remains of a human settlement taken by orcs and wargs in a great
siege. Once peaceful it is now full of these dangers along with the
mighty monument which guards the entrance to the temple and the spirit
of the orc the river is named for it represents a formidable force in
Kore. Many a man have wandered into or towards the city and been taken
or killed.

not recommended for a warrior under the level of 35 to enter the city.
Under no circumstances should someone under the level 45 attempt to
enter the temple.

"DUNBAR'S ROAD" DUNBAR

^Gbackground^n:
Dunbar's Road is the main artery between the abundant farms and orchards
north of Kore to the city's marketplaces. The road was established by Old
Man Dunbar, one of the first to homestead and farm the fertile land. The
road was widened and grew in length as each new pioneer family established
their farms. The road would simply peter out, reduced to a trail, where
the fields turn too rocky for farming. But the road continues westward
for no apparent practical reason. Rumors suggest a pair of secretive
uncanny figures, operating independently, created and army of laborors and
employed them to forge westward. The grocers and produce vendors of Kore
recount farmers' tales of a dark tower and an estate populated by beings
who are alive and yet not. What lies beyond? Adventurers supping and
drinking in Kore's taverns have described a second tower filled with
magic as well as a city of Minotaurs.

^Grecommended levels^n:
This area is mostly peaceful. However, agressive farm animals often
escape their pens and roam freely until their owners can recapture them.
Players below level 10 should avoid this area. Players who are able to
solo guards of Kore will not experience much difficulty, especially if
grouped. Players should also refer to areahelp Estate before they venture
into this area. Players below level 20 should not venture past the
Junction alone and should only proceed with caution.

^Glocation^n:
Dunbar's Road begins west of the countryside north of Kore.

"THE CITY OF BLINGDENSTONE" BLINGDENSTONE

^Gbackground^n:
Svirfneblin are a race of gnomes that have chosen to live in the underdark.
They are much like their cousins in stature and heartiness, but there the
likeness ends. Svirfneblin are more fond of gems than their cousins and
lean more toward clerical ethos. It is this fondness for gems and their
devotion to the god Segojan that the Svirfneblin created the city of
Blingdenstone. A city built over a thousand years ago into the rock itself.
The city has only one entrance, and its proximity to many of the nastier
creatures of the underdark has kept this small city hidden for eons.

^Glocation^n:
Blingdenstone is located deep underground. Although it only has one
entrance there are several ways to make it to the caves that lead to it.

^Grecommended levels^n:
The way to Blingdenstone is long and filled with peril. It wouldn't be wise
for anyone under level 35 to traverse there. But for those brave enough, be
accompanied by a large force of at least four adventurers if you value your
life.

"THE ESTATE OF THE ARTIFICER" ESTATE MALCHOT ARTIFICER

^Gbackground^n:
A very long time ago, a boy was born in the city of Eli. At that time
in history, many boys were growing up with extremely powerful magical
and arcane skills. This boy, named Malchot, became one of the most
famous Artificers that our world has known. However, as he grew older,
and his skills increased, he lost his desire to be with his fellow
Namegivers, and sought only the company of the automatons that he
created. He grew rich off of his inventions, and eventually built a
large estate where he retired. The few visitors that Malchot had
always returned with stories of strange golems and other animated
creatures that kept the Estate in good shape, and kept the Artificer
company. Years have passed without word from the Artificer. It has
been said that the spells that gave "life" to his creations are now
wearing off. Many noted scholars say that the affect this will have on
Malchot's creations is not predictable.

^Grecommended levels^n:
It is rumored that Malchot rarely made machines of war, and stories
from those who have been at the Estate say that all his creations are
harmless. However, those stories are from long ago. The Estate is
designed for levels 9-20, with certain regions being harder than others.

^Glocation^n:
The Estate lays on a large plot of land off Dunbar's Road, north of the city.
It is rumored that the trader Otto, living in the eastern slums, knows the
location of the Estate.

"THE HIDDEN TEMPLE OF VIRMENE" VIRMENE

^Gbackground^n:
Hundreds of years ago the balance of magical energy that surrounds us
strengthened, as it does throughout time. This increase in the world's
magic spurred many great Mages, Clerics, Shaman, Artificers and others to
come forth with their new found, and very powerful magical skills. All of
this magical activity drew the attention of more than one devious creature.
From his far off home plane Virmene, a dreaded and vile entity, came to our
world in an attempt to draw some of its magical strength. While history
is clouded to what exactly banished Virmene, his legacy lived on through
cultists that he himself had control of. Now, Hundreds of years since
Virmene's banishment, there are rumors that his cult is active once again,
constructing horrific creatures, and even attempting to contact the plane
of the Horror Virmene himself...

^Grecommended levels^n:
No mortal under 35th level should enter the lair of the cultists, and any
group of mortals who may encounter the Horror himself would need to be the
strongest of heroes.

^Glocation^n:
No one is certain where the temple of Virmene may be, but history shows
that Virmene often took control of those with power and contacts. Look
for the Horrors taint to be around the established citizens of Kore.

"RUINS OF TROKAIR" TROKAIR

^Gbackground^n:
The Tyrant did not conquer Kore alone. According to history that is becoming
legend, at his right hand was Irinia, the Sorceress Queen, who destroyed whole
armies with horrific creatures summoned from the nether planes. After the
conquest, she was rewarded with Trokair, a persperous city on the eastern
plains. Here the history becomes murky, but sinister rumors whisper that
when the Tyrant gained immortality, Irinia flew into a jealous rage and
swore to conquer Kore to obtain the secret for herself. It is said that she
became obsessed with necromancy, and her reckless experiments tainted and
warped her city, turning it into a place of shadows and its denizens into
legions of undead. Those are the words spoken by the few travellers who have
seen the ruins of Trokair from a distance, and they shiver at the memory.
More is not known, for none who dared to approach closer have returned.

^Grecommended levels^n:
Trokair is a fully armed garrison at battle-ready status, infested by the
undead and creatures from the nether planes. A well equipped group of at
least four to five level 40+ heroes is recommended to ensure survival.

^Glocation^n:
Shrounded both legend and a miasma of thick fog, the location of the ruins
of Trokair is a mystery. It is rumored to be located somewhere east of Kore,
where the undead roam the land. Beyond that, nothing is known.

"WICCA ISLAND" WICCA

^Gbackground^n:
For long the Grand Mistress of the High Tower of Magic has benignly ruled
her subjects. But lately, disturbing reports coming from the sea east of
Kore tell of the reappearance of her deranged sister, the Wicca Herbalist.
Little is known of her activities, apart from the fact that she has taken
up her abode on a large island in the midst of the Sea of Rhun, and filled
it with her fell servants.

^Grecommended levels^n:
This is a huge area, containing many varieties of obstacles for groups of
all levels. Moving through the island requires a great deal of wits in
order to survive, however, as creatures of vastly differing abilities are
often found together. Players under level 30 should never explore in less
than groups of 3 or 4, should watch for danger constantly, and consider
their targets carefully. Note: lemmings hunt in groups when they can!

^Glocation^n:
The island where the Wicca has taken her dominion stands somewhere to the
northeast off the coasts east of the city of New Thalos.
