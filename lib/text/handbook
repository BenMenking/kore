      - Immortals are not allowed to multiplay with a mortal and IMM on
        at the same time. In rare instances an IMP (only) might give
        temporary permission to multi.

      - Immortals are to never cast any spell on a player, give a player
        a piece of equipment (no matter how 'puny' it may be), be
        grouped with a player, or kill things for players. The single exception
        to this rule is as follows: If a newbie (level 8 or under) gets very
        lost you may recall them.

      - To those with the ability to load equipment, you are not to
        reimburse a player, INCLUDING your own, without verbal consent
        from Karn, Kasmir, Zirnozz, Culvan or Ayana.

      - Immortals are never to kill any MOBs, this includes any MOBs in
        unconnected areas, and ESPECIALLY in connected areas. Period.

      - You are not to use your immortal character to locate equipment
        for your mortal or clan. You are also never to tell a mortal
        what equipment is loaded.

      - You are never to use your immortal powers to threaten a mortal,
        if you are found doing this you will be immediately frozen.

Freezing:

      - Don't freeze without cause. Whenever you freeze someone, post
	it to the iceboard in room 1202.

Leveling:

      - Immortal levels mean nothing really. You still want them and
        sometimes you'll get a level. It's mostly arbitrary, levels
        are given as needed.
