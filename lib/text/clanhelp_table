AES SEDAI "AES SEDAI"

   Aes Sedai are the wielders of the One Power.  Since the Time of Madness, all
surviving Aes Sedai are women.  Widely distrusted and feared, even hated by
some, they are blamed by many for the Breaking of the World, and are thought to
meddle in the affairs of nations.  At the same time, few rulers will be without
an Aes Sedai advisor, even in the lands where the existence of such a connection
must be kept secret.  After some years of channeling the One Power, Aes Sedai
take on an ageless quality, so that one old enough to be a grandmother may show
no signs of age except perhaps a few gray hairs.

   Aes Sedai are divided into Ajah.  The Ajah are societies amon the Aes Sedai,
seven in number, and designated by colors: Blue, Red, White, Green, Brown, Yellow
and Gray.  All Aes Sedai except the Amyrlin Seat belong to one.  Each follows a
specific philosophy of the use of the One Power and the purpose of the Aes Sedai.
The Red Ajah bends its energy to finding men who can channel and gentling them.
The Brown forsakes the mundane world and dedicates itself to seeking knowledge,
while the White, largely eschewing both the world and the value of worldly
knowledge, devotes itself to questions of philosophy and truth.  The Green Ajah
(called the Battle Ajah during the Trolloc Wars) holds itself ready for Tarmon
Gai'don, the Yellow concentrated on the study of Healing, and Blue sisters involve
themselves in causes and justice.  The Gray are mediators, seeking harmony and
consensus.  Rumors of a Black Ajah, dedicated to serving the Dark One, are
officially denied.

   Aes Sedai is a Roleplay Clan.  Only female channelers will be inducted, and
they will be required to know their part and play it accordingly at all times.

BLACKLIST
 
    BLACKLIST is a command available only to the leader of a clan. When a
player has been bad for some reason or another, or just wants out of the
clan, the clan leader has the option to BLACKLIST. A blacklisted player
cannot use any clan commands, and will be flagged as OUTCAST.  Outcasts
are not able to join other clans.

CLAN CLANS

    Clans on the Heroes of Kore MUD serve many uses. They function as a way
to make friends, gain respect and prestige, and, in some cases, gain
equipment for your character/s. Once a clan is purchased, the leader has the
option to buy improvements of all sorts. MOBs with the power to cast healing
spells and other personal modifier spells are the most common improvements.
Other improvements include fountains and objects (such as furniture and
statues) are also available, for a price. These facilities are available
only to members of a clan, and can often be an invaluable service.

CLANLEVELS

    Clan levels are available to leaders of a clan and may be set to a
name or term that reflects their clan.

Use promote and demote to use this function.
#
CLANWARS

    Clan wars can be started by any clan leader. In order for this to
happen currently a god must be present to transfer said clans to the fort
arena where either a standard deathquest battle or rigged capture the
leader battle can be run. This is new please watch for updates in the
near future.

#
COUNCIL

    The clan council is primarily made of the leaders of the current clans
of Kore. This council has a hand in the decisions of all clan affairs,
including disbandment, creation, and other issues relevant to clans. Any
clan member may address the clan council in the form of a message, or in
person within the confines of the Chamber of the Clan Council. While the
councils decisions are weighed in accordance, the decisions of the Clan
God, Maerlyn, are final. All clans must have a representative at council
meetings that are scheduled in advance.

#
COVEN

    Forged from the lowest depths of the Abyss by a malevolent goddess,
the coven now bases its powers from a huge cave located underground. The
dark clan rarely accepts neophytes in training, for its apathy and contempt
displayed towards all others makes them forsaken among most races, and the
initiative process of admitting new members is then extremely selective.
Under these ideals, it is advisable that those seeking enlightenment come
to find them.

CREATION

    To create a clan, one must be level 30+ and have a good behavior record
(troublemakers will never have a clan).  You may not be currently enrolled
in a clan with any character.  You must also have a minimum of three people
to join as well.  The cost of starting a clan is three million coins
(3,000,000).  You will receive one room and a bulletin board usable by
members only.  All orders are to be mailed to the clan god, including clan
creation.  Clan leaders of old may reclaim clans from Kore's past.

DYNASTY

    Dissatisfied at the ways of the world, Wehttam, Silk, Alaric, and
Shinthra (the Artist formerly known as Vapor)... four brothers, whose bond
had been tried and tested in countless battles, decided to blaze their own
path, a path in which their dreams might be realized. Thus, they formed the
clan Dynasty, a clan that could and would truly be modeled after their
friendship. The dictates surrounding the friendship between these four
heroes have therefore been extended to become the mandate of Dynasty; one in
which the dictates of brotherhood actually have meaning and there is
equality amongst all members regarding all clan issues. Prerequisites for
joining the ranks of our brotherhood are simple: Respect and Loyalty towards
your fellow clan members.

ELLCRYS HAVEN

There was a time when it was common to see elvish wanderers roaming the 
streets of Kore. That time has drifted to the past.  The fallen ones, the 
cursed dark elves known as drow, have emerged from the deep recesses of 
their undermountain lairs.  One of the dark houses even dares to have its 
name uttered within the walls of Kore.  The dark night has descended upon 
land.  But even in the darkness brought from the underdeep lairs, a light 
gleams.  A small group of elves and half-elves have put aside there 
differences and have pledged to restore the days of peace, to drive back 
the darkness, and to provide for the fair folk of this land a haven, 
Ellcrys Haven.

EMERALD ENCLAVE

    The xenophobic band of druids of the Emerald Enclave care little about
anyone not of their order, and thus don't venture out of the forest unless
searching for some lost tome or other discovery. The circle devotes much
of its time to research, and conversing with the diverse wildlife of the
woodlands. They are a society of zealots intensely dedicated to
protecting the forest and the Balance, and will take any measure necessary
to stop those who endanger these. The entrance to their grove is said to
be hidden somewhere in the Sylvan Woods.

EQUIPMENT

    Clan Equipment is equipment to be used exclusively by members of the
given clan. This equipment is full customizable.  Each clan is limited
to 2 individual items. For alterations a 1 time non-refundable charge of
100,000 coins is required. The equipment created will then be sold
via a shopkeeper in your clanhall for 50k each.

^Gcreation cost^n (including renaming)...................1,000,000+
   Plus 20 of the items to be duplicated (these will not be returned)

These will not be allowed, though already existing eq affects (on the 20
items) can be retained.

^Grestriction removal^n
Good/Evil/Neutral, Warrior, Thief, Mage, etc.

^Gnote^n:
There is a maximum value that none of the things above can exceed.  For
HR, DR, and any other STAT (like DEX) you can only add 2 points in that
field.  For AGE, you may not go above 5.  For hitpoints and mana there is
an equation I have worked out, and to hear about it you can either mudmail
or ask me (Zirnozz) about it in person.  If the item you accumulate for
this process has no inherent hit or mana, then the maximum you may
purchase is 40 points for each value.

Equipment may only be made for the following positions light, body, head,
arms, shield, and held. Though it is recommended that your equipment bare
the clan name in some way it is not required.

INITIATE
 
   A clan leader can INITIATE a person, who has typed PLEDGE, into their
clan. The initiate will get full access to the clanhall and clan functions
once initiated.

#
INTER-CLAN GATEWAY

    Inter-Clan Gateways are used to connect two clanhalls via a two-way
portal.

#
JOIN JOINING PLEDGE
 
    To join a clan you must have two million experience (2,000,000) and
500,000 coins deposited in the bank. Find a clan that suits your needs or
desires and contact the leader about joining. Upon meeting the clan's
requirements you will type PLEDGE -- making sure your gold is IN THE BANK.
The leader of your prospective clan will then initiate you into the clan. It
is advisable to wait to PLEDGE until the last minute, but not required.

#
OUTCAST

Outcasts are people who have been blacklisted from their clan or have
chosen to leave.  An outcast may not join another clan.

#
POLICY RULES

    As a member of any clan, players are expected to follow the rules laid
down by individual clans as well as those placed by clan god. As a clan member
you are expected to heed the following:

      - Respect the players of the MUD who are not involved in a clan as you
        would a fellow clan member, whether you count them as a friend or not.

      - The social bulletin board by the Temple Altar is not to be used for
        clan flames or clan challenges. The only clan notices allowed will
        be advertisements in good taste.

      - Clan members are to adhere strictly to the rules of the MUD. Clan
        members receive less tolerance for breaking rules than do non-affliated
        players.

      - The clan as a whole is held responsible for the actions of its
        members. If one member cheats, the entire clan will be punished.
        Excessive infractions will result in the disbanding of the clan -
        with no refund.

      - Rules and restrictions placed by clan god ALWAYS take precedence 
        over the rules and restrictions placed by the individual clans.

      - Running a clan and belonging to one are priveleges, not rights. They
        may be taken away at any time by any immortal.

      - Clan god is the only immortal with jurisdiction over clans. All clan
        affairs are to be sent to them via MUD mail or relayed in person.

SECONDARY CLANHALL

    Secondary Clanhalls are a way to expand a clans influence into other
parts of the Kore world. The primary clanhall is always located in the 
leader's home city. Secondary Clanhalls can be located in other selected
cities across Kore. Improvements to secondary clanhalls work the same as
improvements to primary clanhalls. Portals connecting different clanhalls
cost as per an Inter-Clan Gateway.

#
TOOT

    Steeped in tradition, Clan TOOT was founded by Ship to uphold honor,
fairness and to champion the plight of the weak.  With Ship's mysterious
departure, Arshes Nei became the clan leader of TOOT.  With the help of
Gargon, they both ventured forth to proclaim the virtues and might of the
clan, helping those less fortunate along the way.  The clan ranks soon 
swelled with new members, all eager to uphold the clan charter and to 
pursue ultimate power.  For TOOT that ultimate power lies in fair play 
and close friends, without either you are nothing.  It is the ultimate 
goal and the ultimate testament to power.
