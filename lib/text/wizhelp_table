    ADVANCE <TARGET> <LEVEL>

#
ASSEMBLE

room as though he or she were actually there. Aliases do not work through 
the AT command. Room numbers, mobiles, and characters can be targeted with 
this skill.

Usage:

    AT <TARGET> <ACTION>

Note: We know that the help says ATT. AT alone didn't work.

#
BAN

    BAN is used to ban certain sites from accessing the MUD. There are 
three types of ban: ALL, NEW, and SELECT. BAN ALL will prevent ANYONE, from 
the banned site, to log in. NEW will ban a site from creating new 
characters. SELECT will ban all players except those with a security flag.
To allow select players to log on, set their SITEOK flag on with:

    set <player> siteok on

Usage:

    BAN <TYPE> <SITE>

    ENROLL <TARGET> <TYPE>

#
FORCE

    FORCE forces a character, MOB or player, to perform the specified 
action. There are three different types of FORCE available. FORCE ALL

    The POLICY file for immortals. It may be updated at any time, so it is
advisable to check it periodically for changes.

#
HCONTROL

person. Do not use it, the house code is VERY crappy and incomplete.

#
HOLYLIGHT

    A toggle command that allows an immortal the affects of:

    - Permanent Detect Invisibility

    - Permanent Infravision

Note:

    Most immortals turn this on when they first begin playing. It is 
usually always on.

#
IMOTD

    The startup login message for all immortals.

#
MOBILES

The word "mob" is short for "mobile", which represents a character in the 
game that is mobile, i.e. can move around of its own free will. Mobs are 
controlled by the MUD, and are sometimes referred to as NPCs (Non-Player 
Characters). 

Mobs normally kill players, except when the players kill them. There are 
exceptions: There's shopkeepers, healers, bankers, receptionists, and some 
others. Getting intelligent behaviour from a mob often requires the use of 
mobprogs. 

The medit command is used to edit mobs. Type medit vnum to edit or create 
a mob, and medit save zone to write all mobs in the specified zone to disk. 

SEE ALSO: MEDIT 

#
MOBPROGRAMS

Mobprogs (or MOBPrograms) are used to generate intelligent behaviour in mobs. 
With a little thought, they can do all sorts of amazing things, ranging from 
simple customize attacks to guards that watch for known thieves and change 
shifts twice a day.

#
PURGE

    PURGE destroys things. If used with no arguments it will clear a room 
of all MOBs and objects, players are unaffected. PURGE can have a target as 
well, such as a MOB, OBJect, even a player. If used to target a MOB, the 
MOB will be destroyed and will leave anything it was wearing or carrying on 
the floor. IF an object is the target, it will simply be destroyed. Purging 
a player functions basically the same way as purging a MOB. All equipment, 
worn and carried, will drop to the ground and the player will be booted 
from the MUD. PURGE is almost never used on characters except for 
permanently frozen ones.

Usage:

    PURGE <NAME or KEYWORD>

REDIT

1) Name: The name of your room that shows up when you enter a room, in the exits
command, in the spell locate object, and in a whole bunch of other places. This 
should be something meaningful: "Outside" is probably a bad name.

2) Description: The description of the room. See help building-standards
   for help on how descriptions should be.

3) Room Flags: As many flags as you need can be set on your room.

4) Sector Type: Defines the terrain. The primary effect is the amount of
   movement points used while walking here. Set it to something appropriate. 

5-E) Exits: Use this submenu to edit the exits for a room.
  1) Exit to: Where this goes. Note that this does NOT automatically create
     an exit in the reverse direction.

  2) Description: As far as I can tell, this doesn't do anything...

  3) Door name: The keywords used to open/close/etc. the door. 

  4) Key: The vnum of the object that serves as a key for this door.

  5) Door flags: Normally, either No door, Closeable door, or Pickproof. 
All doors are assumed to be lockable. The third choice, Breakable floor 
is ONLY useful for exits in the "down" direction. These exits cause 
people to fall crashing through the exit if the weight of all their 
equipment and inventory is greater than a threshold. Set the threshold 
in 4) Key above, instead of typing in the vnum of a key. It must be at 
least 1. Flying characters will not fall through.

6) Purge exit: Remove this exit from the room.

F) Extra descriptions menu: Allows you to add extra descriptions for a 
room. These can be seen by players with the command look keyword. For 
each description, you can set the keywords and what they see when they 
look at it. You can set as many of these as you like, but make sure 
that the player has a good reason to expect there's something to look at!

Q) Quit: Exit redit. You have the option of saving your changes to memory. 
If you like what you've done, say "yes". As always, your changes are not 
saved to disk, and will be lost at the next crash or reboot. Type redit 
save zone to write the changes to disk. The olc command will let you know 
if anything needs to be saved to disk.

REIMBURSE

    REIMBURSE is only to be used under sepcial conditions. REIMBURSE 
accesses a slightly outdated PFILE in a subdirectory, finds the portion of 
the file with your target in it, then reloads that individual's information 
into the active pfile. Basically replacing the new with the old. The 
targetted player MUST NOT be connect to the MUD when you use this command.

Usage:

    REIMBURSE <TARGET>

#
RELOAD

    RELOAD is used to reload certain text portions of the MUD without shutting
down. Common examples are the MOTD and IMOTD. Typing RELOAD alone will 
display a list of things that can be reloaded.

Usage:

    RELOAD <NAME>

#
REMORT

The rules for remorting are as follows:

  set the following:

  level = 1
  experience = 1
  maxhit = 30
  maxmana = 100
  maxmove = 140

  wizreroll the character

  note: If the character wishes to remort and not change race or class, they
  may opt to either take a wizreroll or may have 3 attribute points added to
  their attributes in any order.  Re: +3 str, or +1 dex/int/wiz, etc.

#
REROLL

    REROLL is used to reroll a character's attributes randomly.

Usage:

    REROLL <TARGET>

#
RESETS

The Command list that is displayed in zedit shows you what will happen in
this room when the zone resets. Everything from this point to the bottom of
the menu is specific to this room in your zone everything above this point
applies to your entire zone. 

Each entry in the Command list has a number, beginning at zero and going up.
The final command in the list is labelled END OF LIST and is not a command,
but a place you can add new commands. When your zone resets, the commands will
be executed in numeric order, from top to bottom, and thus, the order of commands
is important. 

SEE ALSO: RESET-COMMANDS

#
RESET-COMMANDS

N) New command: Add a new command to the Command list. First, you tell OLC 
where in the list you want the new command. If you use the number for 
END OF LIST the command will be added to the end of the command list. If 
you use the number of an existing command, the existing command and all 
commands after it will be shifted down, and the new command will go in the 
empty space. There are currently seven possible commands:

M) Load mobile to room: Place a mob in this room. Like all other commands, 
this command can be made dependant on the success of the previous command 
in the list. If this is done, the command will only be executed if the 
previous command executed successfully. To load a mob, you simply need to 
specify the mob's vnum, and the maximum number of these mobs which can exist. 
Unique mobs should be set to 1 here other mobs can vary, but aren't normally 
higher than 10-15.

E) Equip mobile with object: This command loads an object and makes a mob 
wear or wield it. This must always be dependant on the previous command, 
otherwise the MUD may try to give an object to a mob that didn't load. 
After specifying the vnum of the object to load, type in the probability 
that the object loads.

R) Remove an object from the room: Self-explanatory.

O) Load Object to room: Like the E and P commands, the "maximum number that
can exist on the mud" is a probability - enter a number between one and one
hundred. The maximum number that can exist is assumed to be one. As a variation,
if you enter a number larger that 100, the probability of the object loading is
100%, but more than one will load. For instance, if you try to load "an apple"
and set the number to 105, there is a 100% chance that the apple loads, and
a maximum of 5 apples will load.

G) Give an object to a mobile: Similar to E above, but the object goes in the 
mob's inventory instead of being equipped. Again, this command must be dependant 
on the previous one.

D) Open/Close/Lock a door: Simply pick the direction of the door, and what 
state you want the door to be in: Open, closed, or locked. Normally, you want 
doors with keys to be locked, and all other doors to be closed. This command 
isn't normally dependant on the previous one. Make sure that you don't use this
command unless you have created a door with redit already, otherwise it generates 
all sorts of errors in the logs and the imps get upset....

E) Edit a command: This allows you to replace an existing command with another 
one. You can replace it with a completely different command if you wish. You 
can't use this command on END OF LIST.

D) Delete a command: Should be obvious. Don't ever delete a command that has 
other commands dependant on it. And, of course, you can't delete END OF LIST

Q) Quit: Exit zedit. You're given the opportunity to save your changes internally. 
If you like what you've done, you say yes. If you say no, your changes will be 
lost. IMPORTANT: This does not save your changes to disk! You must use the command 
zedit save zone to save the zone to disk, otherwise all your work will be lost on 
the next reboot or crash! The command olc will tell you if your zone is saved or
not.

SHOW require different arguments, such as a name. SHOW without an argument 
displays a list of valid modes.

#
SHUTDOW

    Doesn't do anything. Mainly there so you have to type SHUTDOWN in full.

See Also: SHUTDOWN

#
SHUTDOWN

    SHUTDOWN shuts the MUD down. SHUTDOWN works in three ways: SHUTDOWN REBOOT
will pause for five (5) seconds instead of the normal forty (40) before 
trying to restart the MUD. SHUTDOWN DIE will kill the autorun script; the 
MUD will not reboot again until it is started running manually. SHUTDOWN 
PAUSE creates a file called PAUSED in the root directory, do not restart 
the MUD until the file is removed.

#
SKILLSET

    SKILLSET is a relic of a command from the time when we had skill levels 
on the skills and spells. Do NOT use this command.

#
SLOWNS

    SLOWNS is used to switch numeric addresses to alphabetic addresses. The 
switch however creates lag, and the amount of lag may not be worth the 
luxury of having alphabetic addresses. If your NS (Name Server) is fast you 
should set your SLOWNS to NO. If it is slow, you should set it to YES.

#
SNOOP

    SNOOP allows you to watch another character's seesion. Everything they 
player sees or types will be displayed on your terminal preceeded by a 
percent (%) sign. The ethical considerations to use this command are great, 
and should only be used if the player is suspected of doing something 
seriously against the rules. Abuse of this command WILL NOT BE TOLERATED. 
One strike and you are thrown out.

Usage:

    SNOOP <TARGET>

#
ZEDIT

Usage  zedit vnum

Z) Zone name: This is the title of your zone that will show up in show
zones. If your zone is unfinished or untitled, you must have your builder's 
name included. When your zone is completed, your name can be removed.

L) Lifespan: This is the time between zone resets. The number you type
in is not actually measured in minutes, but in ticks. Currently, ticks
stand at approximately 85 seconds. The number you type in is not exact;
it is unlikely that your zone resets exactly on the specified tick. Instead,
it may be delayed by 20-30 seconds.

T) Top of zone: This is the highest vnum reserved for your zone. Do not
change this! While CircleMUD can quite happily cope with zones that are
shorter or longer than 100 vnums, Oasis OLC cannot.

R) Reset mode: This is the way that your zone resets. Most zones are set
to Normal Reset. This means that your zone will reset every time the Lifespan
(see above) runs out. You can also set your zone to Reset only when no players
in zone, which is useful for more difficult zones, when you want players to
have to fight their way in every time. The final option is Never reset. This  
is fairly uncommon.

F) Zone flags: These are flags that affect the entire zone. As many as neccesary
can be set for each zone.

SEE ALSO ZONES
#
ZONE-FLAGS

NO_TELEPORT: Means that the spell 'teleport' will not transport people to this
zone. This flag must be set on all unconnected zones.

NO_PHASEDOOR: Means that the spell 'phase door' cannot be used inside this zone.
This flag must be set on all unconnected zones. Currently, only vampires have
this spell, and at last count, Kore only had two vampire....

CHAOS: This flag means player killing is permitted in this zone. This flag is
only used for arenas, and should not be set on any other zone.

GODZONE: Zones with this flag can only be entered (via the 'goto' command) by 
higher-level immortals (levels 59 and 60). Generally, you don't use this flag.

BATTLE_OK: The command battle can only be used to enter the arena in zones
flagged BATTLE_OK. This flag is currently only used in the city of Kore,
and should only be set by implementors.

SEE ALSO ZONES
#
ZONES

All new zones on Heroes of Kore are made of 100 rooms, mobs, and objects. So,   
for zone number 112, you would work with mobs 11200-11299, objects 11200-11299,
and rooms 11200-11299. If you need more room, you will have to obtain a second
zone.

These numbers (11200-11299, in this case) are known as vnums, which is short    
for virtual number. These never change, and are the normal way that rooms, mobs,
and objects are referenced by builders and Kore's data files. However, it is
occasionally important to know that internally, CircleMUD uses rnums, which
are real numbers. Rnums will change while the MUD is running.

All zone editing is done through the zedit command. Zones are created by
implementors via zedit new nnn where nnn is the number of the zone. A     
canonical list of exisiting zones can be obtained by the command show zones.
The mortal command areas doesn't show all zones, just some.

The zedit command actually serves a dual purpose: It can edit parameters that  
affect the entire zone, and it can edit the commands to execute in each room   
when the zone resets.

Zedit takes no parameters. Simply type zedit in any room in your zone to enter
the menu. If you are editing the zone-wide parameters, it doesn't matter which  
room you are in. If you wish to edit the command list for a room, you must be   
in that room.

SEE ALSO ZONE-FLAGS ZEDIT RESETS
#
ZRESET

    This command is used to force the target zone to reset. There are three 
types you can use:

  <zone #> = Resets the zone you specify.
      *    = Resets all zones in the MUD.
      .    = Resets the zone you are currently in.
