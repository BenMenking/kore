  say Dylath-Leen?
  say never been there myself
  say but by all accounts, a horrid place
  say dark and windswept with famously spired black towers
  say a port city, full of sailors and cultists
  say its easy to lose your way in Dylath-Leen
  say hey if you're planning on going there tho, would you get me some thagweed?
  grin
