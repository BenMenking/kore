  say So you wish to throw away this mortal life and begin anew.
@
  say I have lived a long and happy life, blessed by love and wealth.
@
  say I would not give up this life for anything.
@
  say I encourage you to reconsider.  Mortals were meant to live one life.
@
  say You may of course try to proceed, but you will have to get past me.
@
  say Nod if you choose to continue, though I believe it a mistake.
  say And I assure you, I will do my best to prove it to you.
