blue flames fire ball mass~
   About as bright as a hundred torches, this large mass of blue flames swirls
in front of you.  Surprisingly, it puts out very little heat.  Nothing seems
to be containing the blue sphere, it simply floats in place here about two
paces above the ground.  Its aura can be seen for miles, and is often used by
the Aesir to guide them to safety during the wicked winter storms that ravage
this area.

made of what looks like fog, although the colors inside it are constantly

on its own will.
