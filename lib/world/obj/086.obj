the Grand Mistress of the High Tower of Magic, and upon the Giants who
fostered them. I fear she controls my ronin, but I too hate the Giants.
I will lead an expedition to the Gem Mountains and find the key to a

of a calico cat on a south shore beach. Prince Covenant and his Citadel
Knights of Bal Harbor are hunting for the key too, but I will win out."
