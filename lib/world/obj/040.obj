ring yellow green~
   Upon closer inspection this ring is made from two interwoven
strands of a yellow and green material, one which you have never
seen before. Each bands seems to be the body of a snake with 
visible scales yet continuous. As you hold the ring in your hand
you feel as though some sort of bond has formed between the two.

that you found in the forest. Thinking back you decide that
that was probably good advice. The mushroom is grey except
for a deep red color underneath the broad cap. You have
heard that some mushrooms can cause a sense of euphoria and
cause hallucinations, but you have never seen any of those.
