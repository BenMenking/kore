rune sword pestilence~
   The moment you lay your hands upon this sword, stabbing feelings
of pain and agony surge through your body. Legend tells of how the
great dragon of the underworld, Proteus, crafted this blade to lay
waste to the borderlands hundreds of years ago. Borne of the most
powerful magic, this sword can only be wielded by the most powerful
of souls. Many arrogant warriors have died holding this blade, not
at the hands of their enemies, but from the sword itself. Beware.

chiseled down painstakingly from a single piece of rock so that they
remain unbroken.  And the gentle smile of the ageless godness shines
on, undimmed by time, offering its wearer unquited gift of comfort and
protection.

   Dwarven craftsmanship imbues this old mining helmet with its special
charm: its lines are angular and yet elegant, and it is filled to every
corner with designs and gadgets both practical and mystifying.  Alas,
a gaping dent on one side of the helmet severely mars its beauty.  Was it
a result of an heavy object hitting it--or the other way around?
Nevertheless, judging by the faint whirring inside the helmet, it is
safe to say that at least some of the helmet's powers remain intact.

dragon, melded and polished by magic so that they fit snugly about the
wearer's waist.  The massive buckle is solid mithril, carved in the
form of a rearing dragon's head, with such presicion that it must be the
old wyrm himself.  Ruby eyes and tongue glower evilly from its maw,
where you find curious depressions shaped to fit a hand... to be wielded?
Flaring wingtips extend from the sides, humming under their own power.

Mightiest of the Three Elven Rings of Power, Vilya was given to
Elrond by Gil-galad just before his departure as co-general of
the last alliance of Men and Elves against Sauron.  The name
Vilya actually translates to 'Air' or 'Sky' from the Quenya
tongue.  Vilya was originally given by Celembrimbor to Gil-galad,
who held it until he went to war at the end of the Second Age.
At that time, Gil-galad bequeathed it to Elrond who wielded it
until the end of the Third Age, at which time it was lost.

   Although the ring looks brand new, you innately sense that it
is an object of antiquity.  Formed from pure gold, powerful magic prevents
it from twisting and bending over the years.  It is free of almost any
adornment save for the carving of fanciful snakes, chasing on another's
tails all over the ring itself.  It is mesmerizing to watch the interplay
of light on their golden bodies, and to admire how the entire process
never seems to end.
