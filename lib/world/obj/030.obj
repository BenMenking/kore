Well I did the best I could in finding out all I could on the
crystals. Seems that the person who is looking for them is on
his way to the realms. From my understanding he should be here
no later then early saturday morning. He will take up shop in
my back room I have here. I am not allowed to talk no more on
this as the dark one has warned. On a brighter note please do
drop by here on saturday as I think I will need the company.
