Highlow Hall, Hathersage, has been described as "reputedly the most 
haunted house in Derbyshire". The first record of a haunting 
there is from the fourteenth century when it is said the 
scheming Nicholas Eyre wooed two sisters for their inheritance. When 
the elder sister found out she fled the hall and was never seen alive 
again. Her ghost is said to have appeared to Nicholas and put a 
curse on the Eyre family.
