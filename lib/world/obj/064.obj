sign crow~
   The Lofty Crow has moved somewhere outside the West gates of Kore.  Land
property is just too expensive here, and out the west gate, we fall into a 
lower tax bracket.  It may be a trip to find us, but the food, drink and entertainment is even better now. So come on down to the new Lofty Crow.
