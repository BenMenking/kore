to know... just post on the mortal board in the room 1 north of temple.

chapter-7 chap-7 remorting~
^GREMORTING^n

   50th level players can run a gauntlet and become a special class
unavailable to mere mortals: Vampire or (soon to come) Knight.
~
E
chapter-6 chap-6 clans~
^GCLANS^n

   This section has gotten so involved... that this part of the newbie guide
now refers you to '^Cclanhelp^n'  <-- check it out.  In clanhelp
there are lists of clans, clan histories, and clan prices...  if you ever
dream of having a big house with your friends (a guaranteed adventuring group)
or forming a club on a mud, a clan is for you.
~
E
chapter-5 chap-5 the different classes~
^GTHE DIFFERENT CLASSES^n

   ^CMagic-users^n begin as novices and become very powerful.  They are probably
one of the easiest classes to level.
   ^CClerics^n are pretty powerful, and a real must-have for a group to stay
healthy and healed.
   ^CThieves^n have good damage from their backstabs but have the special ability
to pick locks which can get them through doors without keys...(and to the
rare eq behind the doors)
   ^CWarriors^n at low levels are pretty buff and at high levels in groups, can
take on very very hard mobs and win pretty easily.
   ^CBards^n are mix, a jack of all trades with some thief skills, some mage
skills and some warriors skills... actually they are not a bad mix at all..
~
E
chapter-4 chap-4 combat~
^GCOMBAT ON KORE^n

   If you've never played a mud before, combat goes like this: Find a 
monster around you by looking or scanning, go to the monster, ^Cconsider^n it to
see how strong or weak it is, ^Cdiagnose^n it to see how hurt or fresh it is,
^Clook^n at it to see if its wearing any equipment you might want, and if it
meets your goals, ^Ckill^n it and ^Cget all from corpse^n.

   Besides hack and slash, the spellcasters (Mage, Cleric) can ^Ccast^n spells
onto mobs to do good damage.  As a general rule though, the spellcasters 
tend to run out of mana pretty fast, and all classes are better off in a ^Cgroup^n
to kill hard mobs.

   One last special twist though that Kore offers is ranged attacks via
readied weapons and ranged spells.. If you experiment, you may find that some
items can be used as ranged weapons (^Cready bow^n) and some spells can be fired
at nearby mobs... this gives you a little flexibility in attacks...
~
E
chapter-3 chap-3 differences~
^GDIFFERENCES BETWEEN KORE AND OTHER ONLINE GAMES^n

   Kore has action a-plenty, but its not an arcade game exactly.  A players
goals vary depending on the person but typically players are: gaining levels,
hoarding gold so they can buy a clan, running around killing monsters for
experience, gold, or equipment, or solving a quest.

   The work that the wizards and immortals have put into Kore set it apart
from other muds.  Kore does not try to be 'realistic' and it can never be
complete, but it can get better, and if you stay on Kore a while, you will
see the game improving around you.

   Compared to other combat muds, Kore's combat is pretty hectic, compared
to purely social muds, Kore has more action -- WAY more action.  But you can
make fast friends here too, like anywhere.
~
E
chapter-2 chap-2 what~
^GWHAT IS HEROES OF KORE ALL ABOUT?^n

The theme:
   ^rHeroes of Kore^n is a mud set in the mythic world of Kore.  Players start
in the City of Kore.  The city is in a crisis, the Tyrant of Kore has
seized power from Kore's ancestral monarch and beheaded him.  Sympathizers
are executed by the Tyrant's Black Guards.  The Tyrant has banished his
equally evil sister Irinia.. and for now a kind of tyrannical peace has 
come over the city.

   As a mud, Kore is trying for: balance, inspired gameplay, lots of combat,
and lots of player amenities.
~
E
chapter-1 chap-1 what~
^GWHAT IS A MUD?^n

   Muds are online roleplaying games.  There are lots of different kinds,
there are dikumuds, moos, mushes, muses, mucks, lpmuds, circlemuds, roms,
mercs, many many different kinds.  The combat-orinted muds (dikumuds, 
lpmuds, circlemuds, roms, mercs and that kind) borrow concepts from role
playing games like Dungeons and Dragons, but because of the nature of Muds
(online and multiplayer and real-time) they are really only RPG-inspired,
not copies of them.

   ^rHeroes of Kore^n is a circlemud.  Circlemuds have good code, good fighting
and good adventuring.

   type '^Ceq^n' to see what you are equipped with.
   type '^Cwear all^n' to put on your gear.
   type '^Cwield sword^n' or '^Cwield dagger^n' or '^Cwield mace^n' or similar.
   type '^Cready bow^n' or '^Cready stiletto^n' or similar to ready your ranged weapon.
2) to see whats around you type '^Clook^n' and '^Cscan^n'.
   to see if you are high enough in levels compared to a mob, '^Cconsider^n ^R<mob>^n'
   to see if the mob is hurt.. type '^Cdiagnose^n ^R<mob>^n'
   to see if the mob has equipment you might want, '^Clook^n ^R<mob>^n'

great dragon of the underworld, Proteus, crafted this blade to lay
waste to the borderlands hundreds of years ago. Borne of the most
powerful magic, this sword can only be wielded by the most powerful
of souls. Many arrogant warriors have died holding this blade, not
at the hands of their enemies, but from the sword itself. Beware.

   Dwarven craftsmanship imbues this old mining helmet with its special
charm: its lines are angular and yet elegant, and it is filled to every
corner with designs and gadgets both practical and mystifying.  Alas,
a gaping dent on one side of the helmet severely mars its beauty.  Was it
a result of an heavy object hitting it--or the other way around?
Nevertheless, judging by the faint whirring inside the helmet, it is
safe to say that at least some of the helmet's powers remain intact.

form of a rearing dragon's head, with such presicion that it must be the
old wyrm himself.  Ruby eyes and tongue glower evilly from its maw,
where you find curious depressions shaped to fit a hand... to be wielded?
Flaring wingtips extend from the sides, humming under their own power.

Mightiest of the Three Elven Rings of Power, Vilya was given to
Elrond by Gil-galad just before his departure as co-general of
the last alliance of Men and Elves against Sauron.  The name
Vilya actually translates to 'Air' or 'Sky' from the Quenya
tongue.  Vilya was originally given by Celembrimbor to Gil-galad,
who held it until he went to war at the end of the Second Age.
At that time, Gil-galad bequeathed it to Elrond who wielded it
until the end of the Third Age, at which time it was lost.

frosty tri bladed dagger~
   The cold of its metal shivers through your spine giving you the feel of
the cold harshness of the death it brings.  You physically shiver as you begin
to wield the massive dagger and wonder if you release it, if the cold will
ever leave you.  You fear that it would not.

ring gold intertwined snakes~
   Although the ring looks brand new, you innately sense that it
is an object of antiquity.  Formed from pure gold, powerful magic prevents
it from twisting and bending over the years.  It is free of almost any
adornment save for the carving of fanciful snakes, chasing on another's
tails all over the ring itself.  It is mesmerizing to watch the interplay
of light on their golden bodies, and to admire how the entire process
never seems to end.
