necklace shiny cogwheels copper metal~
The links of this necklace seem to have runic inscriptions similar to the
Master Tinker's hauberk, but one letter at a time.  The copper is highly 
polished and has a burning red tint to it, suggesting an unusually pure
source of copper was used to make it.

The headdress of the Master Fletcher of Dale consists of an example from the
finest batch of arrowtips made in the lifetime of each of the preceding 
Masters, for a total of fifty-four in a finely stitched hoop.  Although
some of the tips are crudely bent out of shape from obvious use, they all
sparkle brilliantly, being made of the finest silver available.

trophy terrasque gold image~
a terrasque trophy~
You see an image of pure gold depicting a mighty warrior, standing over a terrasque.~
You hold in your hands a small statue of pure gold, depicting a mighty warrior,
a hero of Kore if you will, standing defiantly over the body of a defeating terrasque.
As you stare into the image, your eyes glaze over and you behold just the beginning
of the sufferings that this champion had to endure to be rewarded with such honor.
It is not in the blood of any warrior to take on such a mighty beast, and yet live
to tell about it.  This truly was a Hero, a Hero of Kore.
