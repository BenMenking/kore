fountain pool water waters plume~
    Before you stands the most strikingly beautiful display of expert
craftsmanship you have ever seen. Crafted from carved tiles and colored
mosaic chips, the water fills a basin roughly eighteen inches deep and
nine feet across. A tiered cascade sculpture rises from the center
creating a trickling fall of water down through each of the four levels of 
basin. Out of the very top, a great plume of water erupts straight up in
regular intervals. The water forms a mushroom before raining down to
collect in each of the basins. The water itself is crystal clear with its
ripples focusing shadows down across the bottom of the main basin.
Tenatively you dip a finger in the water and find it cool and, most likely
very tasty.

The evil money changer explains that he can do this for you:
'BALANCE', 'WITHDRAW <amount>', or 'DEPOSIT <amount>'.
