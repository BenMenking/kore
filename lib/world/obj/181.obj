The Fable of the UgaLump
    Hundreds of years ago, a mad wizard created a devilish and
evil creature called the UgaLump.  The UgaLump was intended to
drive humans and other name-givers from the planet by over populating
the world.  These creatures reproduce at an incredible rate and
eat almost anything they can get their hands on.
Recently, someone has found the mystic receipe for creating the
   <type read page2>
~
E
page2~
dreaded UgaLumps and has brought them back into existance.
You must help me destroy them at all costs! There are four kinds
of UgaLump. Immature Ugalumps are the easiest to slay, large adult
UgaLumps are much harder. An adult that does not mate goes crazy, and
becomes a rabid UgaLump, which is very dangerous.
   <type read page3>
~
E
page3~
The biggest threat to our safety is the elusive gravid UgaLump.
Each gravid UgaLump can have up to 25 babies!
I value the pelts of the UgaLump in that order (immature, large
rabid, gravid). The person who brings me the most number of pelts
will be rewarded handsomely. PLEASE NOTE that the pelts will be
awarded 1 point for immature, 2 for large, 4 for rabid and 5 for
gravid.  
    <type read page4>
~
E
page4~
I know that the UgaLumps have been seen in the slums of Kore (E & W).
They have also been spotted in New Thalos, New Shire, King Welmar's
Castle and in the Homonculus King's Castle.  Please go kill them,
and help us save Kore!!!
Prizes will be UNIQUE, as I am dipping into my own private 
treasure chest.

Years ago, in the previous Age when the Tyrant did not rule, the eccentic genius Malchot was one of Kore's
premier mages.  Having lost his family during the siege of Bone Hill, Malchot silently plotted revenge his whole
life.  While mastering the art of creating artificial life, Malchot created a self reproducing warrior entity.

 He named these creations 'UgaLumps' because it was a term his now deceased young daughter used to use.  These creatures were organic, reproduced and grew quickly and were voracious hunters, however they had a short life span. The idea was that a group of UgaLumps could be released to destroy the residents of Bone Hill, then die out shortly after that.

page3~
The UgaLumps were released, and most of the vile residents of Bone Hill were destroyed. The UgaLumps, however, did not die, they continued to thrive. This was the first Scourge of UgaLumps. It took hundreds of Heroes and many months to destroy the UgaLump threat.

Malchot could never bring himself to destroy something he had created, so instead he created a meta-plane and stocked it full of wildlife. He then released the last of the UgaLumps to this meta-plane where they could thrive and not do damage to the residents of Kore. The meta-planed remained sealed for hundreds of years.

About four years ago, an insane mage obssesed with Malchot's creations opened the portal of the meta-plane and released a small group of UgaLumps to our plane. This was the second Scourge. Fortunately for Kore, the heroes dispatched the UgaLumps and resealed the plane. The insane mage, named Darius, was never found and assumed dead.

Recently the High Seer of the Tyrant has predicted that a portal to the UgaLump's plane has just been opened. It is required that all able bodied men and women assemble immediately to thwart the UgaLump threat. There are six types you will encounter:

Hatchlings : easy to kill when generally less than a few hours old. Neonates: large enough to kill a man, but relatively easy to dispatch.  Immature : More than a challenge for normal men.  Large : the standard Adult form, ferocious in battle.  Rabid : An un-mated adult goes insane, and is very dangerous.

Gravid : Eggbearing Adults, destroy these by any means possible.   the Matriarch : only one Matriarch exists, she is the source of all the UgaLumps. Destroy her or all is lost.

If grouped for any kills, points will be split amoung group members. The Quest will last one hour, or until all UgaLumps are dead, whichever occurs first.
