blood bloodsword longsword sword~
This hefty weapon is covered to the hilt in fresh, sticky blood.  The blade
gives off a faint crimson aura, and hums softly in the air.  Closing your
palm around the handle, a warm feeling slowly crawls up your arm.  A tingling
sensation soon follows, and energy you didn't know you possessed begins to
well up from some hidden reservoir.  Wielding this sword, you feel as if you
can take on the world.

be mighty.

As you stare into the flaming mass, you feel the need to shield your eyes, as
the fire burns almost bright enough to blind.  Slipping the smouldering 
gloves onto your hands yields a rush of numbing cold temperature race through
your veins.  You feel nigh invulnerable with these on, an almost scary
proposition to be in while locked in mortal combat.

a strange feeling, like bony hands tickling your spine envelops your body.
As a young child, you remember hearing legends of a once powerful cleric who
single-handedly drove back the undead hoards at Folkurk pass.  The warrior
 channeled too much magic, and in the end his soul was sucked into the only
remaining vesture-- his red belt.
