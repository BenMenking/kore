defender belt~
the belt of the defender~
A strong, good looking belt lies here.~
   This belt looks amazingly similar to Brekstacks, the caption of the
orcish army. The old legend says that this belt was given to the defender
so that he may better fulfill his duties. Brekstack was one of many followers
that Orsus inspired during his reign as the god of vengeance and although he
appeared infrequently many did follow him.

mace blood~
   A large mace stained with the blood of all races.  This is the legendary
mace that Orsus the orcish God of Vengeance once used to dispence his rage
on all those that crossed him. It is said his spree was started when his
wife was caught cheating on him with another man, a human. Following the
humans demise, he constructed this mace, using the blood of the man to cool
the heated metal. From then on, he killed everyone who had ever crossed him
and let their blood dry on the mace.
