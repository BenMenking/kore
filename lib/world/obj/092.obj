statuette statue snake goddess white~
   You look at the statuette and feel a moment of peace deep inside you.
It might be the jungle heat but you find her face to be that same peaceful
face you recognize from somewhere before... 
   The statuette is armed with a long wavy kris, holds a fireball in the
other, makes a peace gesture with one hand, gestures for you to leave with
the other, holds a sickle in the bottommost hand, holds a skull in the
other.

bowl incense~
   A plain laquer bowl, but very holy.  It contains sand, and stuck into the
sand are long sticks of incense.  Three of them in all, and placed very
precisely.
   A miracle, for they never seem to burn out.
