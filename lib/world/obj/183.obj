eye symbol sign virmene~
   The Eye of Virmene, even its name evokes fear from most of the worlds
population. Hundreds of years ago, a stupid Mage was tricked by an odd
cultist to open a portal to a strange and distant meta-plane. The plane was
the home of the powerful entity Virmene. The Horror Virmene then wandered the
world for years,killing thousands of people, spreading countless diseases and
driving thousands more insane. It took a huge group of heroes to eventually
drive Virmene back to his plane and seal the portal. Even now, hundreds of
years later, his name is uttered only in hushed tones. The sight of this
symbol means that a cult may be down here, you just hope that they have not
found a way to open a portal to his plane.

anvil maker~
   This huge black anvil seems very awkward to wield, but the amount of
power you feel surging through your body while holding it makes any
amount of uncomfort quite bareable.  The mystic runes glow in some unknown
arcane tongue, seemlingly blinding to all those around you.
