a set of assassins throwing stars~
A handful of throwing stars sit here in the dirt.~
   A handful of stars supposedly taken from the sky at night by Orlon the Orc
god of death.  These stars were taken from Orlon when he was killed by Orsus for
undermining his attempts to remove the immortal race, which in this grand world
appear rarely during the day and almost always at night.

orc ceremonial shield~
   The body length mirrored shield is made to confuse the enemy.  Although it
isn't overly strong it is exceptionally confusing and due to the fact it is hard
to construct it is exceptionally rare.

   You look at the green paste which the man has already explained will cure
any poison that would befall the adventurous.  It smells of toadstool and some
sort of animal droppings although you can't seem to figure out what it is.

   You look at the bark of the lambar tree which looks more like the skin of an
old woman it smells of noxious odours and looks like someone has eaten it.
The man said that it gave certain enhancements to the user and that the side
effects were little.

   You were told this was the petrified remains of a lambar tree.  It looks more
like rocks but you bought them anyways.  He said that swallowing the rocks would
allow you to gain some of your health back.  You pray it doesn't give you kidney
stones.

disgusting flower~
   Similar to the incense in the temple this flower puts orcs into a trance.
Somes races claim the trances fully recharge their being.  The stories you have
heard most is that this puts people to sleep.  As you left the store it appeared
that the shopkeep had found something amusing.

   The cold of its metal shivers through your spine giving you the feel of
the cold harshness of the death it brings.  You physically shiver as you begin
