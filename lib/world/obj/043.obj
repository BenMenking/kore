^wLegend of Shipwreck Point.^n
During the Razing, Zhentil Keep lost all of its seagoing fleet.
Most of the vessels were caught by white dragons and blasted
frozen with icy breath weapons until they became miniature
icebergs, floating tombs for the quick-frozen sailors caught
within. So here lies the remains of the vessels as they are
washed up on Shipwreck Point.
