   ^YGeneral Guidelines^n

   I. No profanity is allowed in descriptions.
  II. Develop a theme for your zone. Choatic zones will not be connected.
 III. Once again, descriptions should be very creative and in depth.
  IV. If you cheat, you ^RWILL^n be frozen.
   V. Pick a zone connection point that is suitable for your zone.
  VI. Keep the quality of the eq. relative to the mob it loads on.
 VII. ^CSAVE OFTEN!^n
VIII. Have fun creating your zone.
  IX. Worship Proteus(optional).

   ^YZone(Room Commands)^n

   These are what tell the mud to load and item, mob, or an item
   on a mob to a room. The first command is alway 0. Follow the 
   prompts to customize the command. When it says ^GNumber of items
   allowed on mud^n, this is the loadrate. For example, if you set
   this to 80, the item or mob would load 80% of the time. If a command
   is dependent on the command before it then the item or mob has to load
   for the second command to have a chance of taking place.
~
E
page16~

   ^YZone(Settings)^n

   ^MName^n sets the name of your zone. ^MLifespan^n is how often
   your zone resets, between 15-45 is standard. ^MTop of Zone^n is
   the first room in your zone, ^RDo not change this^n. ^MReset mode^n
   is how your zone resets. ^GNo reset^n only resets on reboots. ^GNormal
   reset^n resets every interval specified by ^Mlifespan^n. ^MReset when
   there are no players in zone^n is just what it says.

   ^YZone(OLC)^n

   entire zone as well as individual room commands.

   ^YMobs(Mobprograms)^n

   Mobprogs are what really make mobiles in your zone lifelike.
   Mobprogs can be greetings, or programs that interact with the
   PC when he/she types a certain string, or they can be fightprogs
   which cast spells and initates special attacks during combat.
   An entire supplement to this guide will be devoted entirely
   to the in's and out's of mobprogramming. If you have any questions
   on mobprogs, ask an IMP.
~

page13~

   ^YMobs(Flags)^n
   ^MNPC^n flags sets the behavior of the mob, i.e. a ^Ghelper^n
   mob will jump into help(fight with) another mob that is being
   attacked in the same room.  ^MAFF^n flags set special 
   characteristics of the mobs, i.e. whether the mob is sanc'ed
   or it has infravision. 
~
E
page12~

   ^YMobs(Attributes)^n

   ^MKeywords^n,^MName^n,^MLook^n, and ^MDesc^n are all the same as
   items except for a mob. ^MAlignment^n sets whether the mob is good
   or evil. ^MLevel^n sets the difficulty of the mob(damage and hitroll
   are set when you set level). To set damroll, select C, and enter
   amount. ^MArmor class^n is how hard it is to hit the mob(-100 to 100).
   ^MGold^n is usually 100k-150k for a level 50 mob and 10-15 coins for a
   level 1. Give mobs gold accordingly.
~

   ^YMobs(OLC)^n

   To edit a mobile(Mob) type ^Gmedit <mob#>^n. To see a list of all
   the mobs in your zone type ^Gvnum mob <zone#>^n. The difficulty of
   the mobs in your zone determines the relative level of your zone.
   For example, a newbie zone would have lots of easy, low level mobs.
   As with room descriptions, mob descriptions should be detailed and
   creative. 
~

   ^YRooms(Doors/Exits)^n

   To connect two rooms you must have an exit between the
   two rooms. However, once you connect one room to another
   the connection is only one way(from the room you where 
   editing).  You must go to the room that you connected to and
   do the same process.  Doors can be set to lockable(need a key)
   and pickproof(only openable with key).  Mazes usually consist
   of a lot of one way exits and exits to the same room number.
~
E
page5~

   ^YItem Flags^n

   These are the flags that set the characteristics of the item.
   ^MType^n sets the type of item it is, i.e. a key, armor, or a light
   source. ^MExtra flags^n set things such as level restrictions and
   race restrictions. ^MWear flags^n set if an item can be worn or
   not and where it can be worn. A longer description of each flag
   will appear in a supplement to this guide.
~
E
page4~

   ^YDefining Items^n

   For the ^MKeywords^n add applicable keywords for the item. This is what
   players will type to interact with the item. For ^MName^n, this is
   the actual name for the item that is displayed when the item is
   interacted with. ^MLook^n is what the player sees when he/she looks
   in a room that contains the item, i.e. A steel mace lies here.
   ^MDesc^n is what the player sees when he/she looks AT the item, i.e.
   This steel mace is made of steel.
~
E
page3~

   ^YOLC (Items)^n

   To view a list of all the items in your zone type ^Gvnum obj <zone#>^n
   The first item in you zone will be your zone number followed by a 00.
   For example, zone 182's first item is 18200.  To edit an item, type
   ^Goedit <item#>^n.  Items can only be refered to by there item# when
   editing.

   is designed to guide you through the building process and answer
   some of the questions you have.  I have tried to compile all of the

   to edit. Rooms are what define the size and appearence of your zone
  so you want to make them as descriptive as possible. You not only
   want to describe the physical features of the room but also set
   the atmosphere of the surroundings(a good example of this is the
   Ruins of Trolkiar). But above all, be as creative as possible.

   ^YDefining Rooms^n

   In defining your rooms, as stated on the previous page, you want
   to be as descriptive as possible. The are also some rules to 
   follow. One, each room description should be indented 3 spaces.
   Two, directions like "There are exits east and west" should not
   be included. Three, there should only be one space after a period.
   These rules are designed to make Kore more uniform and therefore
   better looking.
