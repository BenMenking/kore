ring thri kreen marriage~
   It appears to be just a simple solid gold band. It is
used to marry Thri-Kreens. However, holding it in your hand
you can feel its power pulsing into you. Examining it closely
you notice that it is scratched and nicked, as if its rather
old. Looking at the inside edge closely you see that it
bears and inscription, "To Nicolate with all my love. KT";

mirror silver~
   You see a beautiful silver mirror. Engraved upon its back are
a pair of trees. They are quite unlike anyother tree you've ever
seen before. They seem to resemble an oak, yet are just a bit
different. You seem to fell a magical presence emminating from
the mirror, it also appears to be concentrated upon the trees.
This mirror might be a very powerful object, and should be treated
with care.
