history tale avalanche~
   A granite topped mace has drawn your attention, and you cannot seem to make
yourself turn away. The head is solid granite and seems to me magically molded
and reinforced. The haft on which the head is afixed is made of a strange
black wood, with glowing red runes pulsating along it. As your fingers brush
along it, a soft voice reaches your mind...
   "Avalanche..." the voice says in a whisper. It begins to speak again, 
weaving the story of its creation, "I was made during the dragon wars as the
weapon of the greatest healer to ever live. My head is made of granite from
the Valley of the Damnned, in the blasted wastes of Ghrolm. Forged by the
God of Neutrality himself, I have been blessed and enchanted with runes and
essences from his healers. Given to Thorin the Gold, I served him throughout
the war, slaying evil humans, elves, dwarves, and dragons allied against the
side of good, intent on destroying our world. For 50 years did I serve Thorin,
but at the battle of Storm Cragg, he was slain by the retreating horde, and I
was lost to the mountains.
    Six millenia I have been lost, but that has changed, with the return of
the Tyrant, and that of the good dragons, led by Nightsky, I have been 
recovered and given my destiny. My destiny is to serve you, and beat down the
dark forces which threaten to destory our world once more. I carry your honor
Wehttam of Rubicon, and together we shall be victorious."
    With the tale finished, the voice fades off silently, and your mind is
once again your own.

mom sword shortsword bane~
   You see a sleek, beautiful, and sharp looking sword lieing in silver
inlaid scabbard. In pure wonderment in how someone could leave such a valuable
treasure just lieing about, you soon realize your mistake as you pick it up.
A clear voice rings in your head and you close your eyes as you kick yourself
for even touching the accursed thing.

   "Sit up straight, child!" the voice says. "For god sakes, get the hair out
of your eyes if you ever want to attract a woman!"

   Thinking to yourself, you realize this thing is WORSE than your real mother.
Another problem being that the thing actually thinks it is your mother. You
try to put the sword down wher eyou found it, but as soon as you let go it
reappears in your hand. One of your friends looks strangely at you, and in a
trembling voice informs you that your sword is talking to him. It told him to
get you something to eat, give you a comb, and to make him sit up straight.
Apparently, your demise has taken another form.
