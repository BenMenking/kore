chapter 10 ten end beginning~
  Mopono's companions have erected for me a glowing fortress, and a 
spacious laboratory, locked within a labyrinth.  Here I shall live 
and work, while Mopono's human tribe, the Djabarim, settle down into 
a village far above our heads.  This will be the final entry into this 
journal, as I go into isolation.  Perhaps whoever takes the time to 
read this will venture forth and join our ranks.
~
E
chapter 9 nine home~
  Mopono led me deep into the ground, to a huge cavern that would 
become our home.  I was introduced to his campanions, an interesting 
array of dragons.  We all discussed the plans I have in my head, and 
while some were more receptive than others, all were at least 
interested.  For my part, I will isolate myself to perfect the 
enchantment of the amulets, while Mopono will gather his human tribe 
of worshipers to provide our potential champions.
~
E
chapter 8 eight sleeping dragon~
  Having escaped, I proceeded deeper into the woods, eventually coming 
to a large clearing.  As I stood there in serenity, something caught my 
eye.  I could hardly believe it, right there in that clearing, was a 
huge sleeping dragon.  I approached with apprehension, but as I placed 
my hand upon its head, we began to speak, and somehow understanding 
each other, I explained to him my dreams.  The great dragon, Mopono, 
shared my vision, and we left the clearing allies.  
~
E
chapter 7 seven escape~
  Disaster.  I barely escaped with my life and the basis of my research.
It seems the guards learned of my activity and didn't take lightly to 
the death of one of their comrades.  While I could easily have killed 
them, I will not do so without good cause.  I fled.  I'm sure my 
laboratory was destroyed and my young dragon slaughtered, but I escaped,
fleeing west along the great forest road.  Eventually, with a bit of 
cunning, I misdirected my pursuers.  I was safe, but at what cost?
~
E
chapter 6 six progress~
  As I had hoped, I enlisted a volunteer, a strong and very capable
member of the corps.  He fought the small dragon bravely and
effectively.  The dragon gazed into the amulet, seeming to contemplate
the possible path open to it, when the fool dropped his guard and the
dragon, not missing the opportunity, struck.  On the verge of deafeat,
the dragon summoned its inner power and won.  Perhaps I need further
mastery of the enchantment in order to succeed.
~
E
chapter 5 five initial failure~
  I'm afraid my efforts at using the town peasants were somewhat 
disastrous, and very gruesome.  The young dragon is far more capable 
than I had initially expected.  Perhaps for a fair wage I could entice 
some of the guards of the city to take a chance.  They are underpaid 
and frequently in search alternate sources of income.
~
E
Chater 4 four first tests~
  The process is quite simple if the enchantment and the combatants are
truly ready.  A person dons the amulet and enters into combat with the
dragon.  If the dragon is weakened to the point of death, it may choose
to merge its power with that of the combatant, therby uniting their 
strengths and augmenting them.  Some of the lowly peasants of town will
do almost anything for some wine, perhaps even enter combat with a 
baby dragon...
~
E
preparations chapter 3 three~
  With a dragon soon to be in my possession, I am almost ready for
initial testing.  I shall have to establish a laboratory of my own
however, as my master, the fool Belbrecht, cannot learn of this.  While
the old man has taught me much, I fear his wits are slipping away
rapidly.  I surely would hate to be around when he snaps.  I have
picked a location on the outskirts of town to begin my work.
~
E
chapter 2 two beginnings humble~
  Today I acquired the key piece to the puzzle.  To proceed with my
testing, I needed a dragon, still young and weak.  A travelling
merchant of some worth came to town, and under a cover of darkness I
approached the guards of his caravan.  The fools were completely
unaware.  Before they knew anything was wrong they were asleep, and
they will awake tomorrow with no recollection.  I walked right out with
what I can only assume is a genuine dragon egg.
~
E
chapter 1 one research~
  Today I came upon a local peddling a book of myth and adventure as he
called it.  It is truly amazing.  On the surface it chronicles the tale
of the dragon knights of yore, the ancient dragoons.  But more 
importantly, it contains the enchantments and spells that bound the 
power of the dragons to their champions.  As for how this book made it 
into the hands of a lowly peddler, I can only thank the fates.

read diary book ackularn somebody~
  A piece of paper has been inserted into the front of the book.
In fine penmanship is written:

Here I chronicle the grand adventure that my life has become.
Starting innocently enough, as a simple apprentice, I have
become far more, and now have truly grand apirations.  Herein
I shall detail the history of my actions, so that those who 
will someday judge me will understand what had to be done.

The second page lists the ^ccontents^n of the diary.
