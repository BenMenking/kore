circlet dim crown~
   A thin silvery band is a blending of mithril and adamantite, combined in 
an explosion of great heat.  This metal was found, shaped and enchanted by 
an unknown elf of a forgotten branch.  It was lost to him somewhere in the
Underdark, and has slipped through many wearer's hands since then.
