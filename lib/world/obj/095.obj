from some foreign substance because unlike glass it takes a beating and

a gnarled staff~
A gnarled oak staff lies here discarded.~
   The wood of the staff you don't recognize.  It is hard yet it does not
seem to have dried, perhaps kept moist by some magic power.  It has some 
strange writing on it and you find yourself lost in its words.  It wraps 
around your hand as if it wants to stay with you.

onyx ring~
   The onyx of this ring seems to absorb the light from the surrounding room 
and redirects it directly into the soul of the wearer giving him the power 
to cast more spells and increase his vitality.  It is of the purest onyx, 
crafted by the finest blacksmith.  You find it hard to believe that such a 
pure ring could fall into the hands of such poor men.

invisible to the naked eye and only with the aid of potion or spells is it
visible.  In its invisible form it draws powers from the another displaced
reality.

tip of each boot is a razor wedged in to add to their destructive capabilities.

Upon holding this cumbersome seeming blunt weapon is actually very light,
and you can see how it has aided its master by examining its scratches and

a sense of power and confidence over any opponent, fills your head with
fantasies of victory, and now you understand why its previous master was so
unwilling to let it go.

it is a useless piece of equipment.
