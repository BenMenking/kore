evil money changer~
The evil man leans close and chuckles!  He looks pretty rich but old and
evil. He counts money into neater piles than the banker and chuckles
unwholesomely with each tally in his ledgerbook.
The evil money changer explains that he can do this for you:

'BALANCE', 'WITHDRAW <amount>', or 'DEPOSIT <amount>'.

But then asks, 'Why not just buy a balance sheet and keep track of it
yourself?!?'

Please report any strange occurrences to the bank manager.
Hmm! ...Using this balance sheet is a lot like actually being at a bank!
