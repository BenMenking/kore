miraculous properties which could cure illnesses, and protect against the ill 
effects of witchcraft. Moreover, whenever enemies met under the mistletoe in 
the forest, they had to lay down their arms and observe a truce until the next 
day. From this has seemingly come the custom of hanging a ball of mistletoe 
from the ceiling and exchanging kisses under it as a sign of friendship and goodwill.
