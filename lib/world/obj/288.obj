rusted key~
a miniscule rusted key~
A tiny key, rusted by age lies on the ground.~

sign~
An old rotten sign~
An old rotten sign stands battered by the wind and dust of years.~
      Think wise, think twice
   and leave behind any pretense
   gather stranger all your sense
     pay good mind to my advice
     for the fae do not reason
     the way simple mortals do
   wealth and gold you may accrue
    or you may end up imprisoned
   beware stranger of the rings!
    let the faeries dance alone
for their dance and chant strip bone
the flesh ground on sharp edged wings
