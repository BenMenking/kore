statue immense idol Calis~
Measuring over a fifty feet in height, it is hard to imagine the great
work it must have taken to carve such a monument.  The figure is a man in
long sweeping robes sitting on a throne erected upon a mound of bodies,
and the face is almost frightening in its near-perfect beauty.  Even being
inanimate, the eyes carry a visage of pure evil, and they almost seem to
follow your movement around the cave.

coffin casket bed~
Engraved elegantly by the finest of artisans, this reddish-brown casket
is a work of art all unto itself.  Every inch of its casing is marked
with carvings, light and deep, depicting scenes of mass death, dying, and
destruction.  Through the representations one figure is notably at center,
his eyes glazed over, his hands gushing with ruinous energy so great that
they're unrecognizable.  The blood of others covers his entire body.

are held in this bottomless cauldron, and upon looking deep into the
murky waters and viewing movement therein, it is not a hard to give
credence to.

mandrax statue dolere~
    The statue was carved by a master, possibly by magic. The attention to
detail is remarkable and the polished surface seems to glow softly. The
light of the room plays off the visible portion of the face and give you
an eerie feeling of being watched. Gazing over the sculpted figure you
see that it is garbed in thick concealing robes with a hood that shadows
the face. Sitting in a throne next to another statue, just as impressive,
the figure clutches a staff with a crystal at the top. Moving across the
room to get a better view of the figure's face, you jump in surprise as
the head follows your movements, and a glowing red eye appears in the
visible portion of the face. You know who this is now, and you feel
afraid. For you have found the statue of the Nosferatu Mandrax, founder
of Dolere. Kneel manling... and pay homage to your history.
