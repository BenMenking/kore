The Ferryman stands here, ready to help you across - for a price.

He's wearing a worn, tattered set of plain, simple clothes. His unkempt
gray hair nicely complements his unshaven, aged face. His eyes look off
into space, ignoring your presence. You get the sense this man has been
standing here forever and doesn't plan on moving.
