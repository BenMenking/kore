a brown bear~
A large shaggy brown bear is here, gnawing on some bones.

   This bear is large and monstrous.  It has dark shaggy fur, and razor-sharp
claws.  At the moment, the bear appears pre-occupied with a large juicy bone
it has picked out from a carcass.  You notice its face is bloody from a recent
gorging of food, but it appears its hunger has not yet been sated.  The bear,
eyeing you, drops his bone and slowly licks his lips with a sadistic glee.
