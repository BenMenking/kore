white fangs and his razor-sharp talons.  It is the diety worshiped in this
temple, and according to the prophecy, is destined to rule the world once
raised from the depths of the Abyss.

the Pit Fiend~
The Pit Fiend, ruler of the abyss, sits here on his throne.
~
This is the ruler of the Abyss, who is destined to rule the entire world, once
released by its worshipers from this Pit made to entrap him.  His skin is
harder than tempered steel, and hit talons are longer than a man's hand.  He
bears a vague resemblence to a gargoyle, only his skin is black and his fangs
drip an acidic green ichor when he opens his mouth.  It is said that only a
god can match magical power with a Pit Fiend, but he can be controlled by any
mortal that speaks his name.
