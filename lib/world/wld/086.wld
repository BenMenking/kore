The Choppy Reefs~
   The water here is especially cold, but what is interesting is that the 
reefs are so numerous that you can stand waist-deep in the water, and see the 
outline of a shore split by a river-delta some distance to the north.

Estuary of the River Qix~
   Driftwood and other debris, including the remains of hapless sailors, lead 
you to the conclusion that a ship recently charged the reefs. As you ponder 
the fate of the lost crew, and wade through what's left of them, you shudder 
with the feeling that you are shome    omehow being watched...

Before the Delta~
   The water here is again shallow enough to stand in, and considerably 
warmer that that beyond the reefs. As you face the delta of grey silt to your

empties *from* the sea inward. As    

Delta of the River Qix~
   As the water trickles past the muddy surface that you are standing on, you 
ponder what kind of rock would last very long in the midst of all these tidal 
forces. A quick scuffing of your foot into the sand reveals the impossible: 
the delta is essentially one large diamond weighing countless tons. Reeling 
from this discovery, you reevaluate your sanity and whether to continue on.

found the river now too deep to walk through, the only option seems to be to 
float down it to discover whatever else is to the north of the flood plain, 
as the mountains are certainly impassable.

   A sky normally devoid of all but the occasional huge predator is suddenly

Quite apart from the swordfish in the river, these seem to take off like a 
shot for the cave-mouth as soon as they hit the water, instead of moving 
about in a search for prey. You fight to stay afloat as they occasionally hit 
you, some weighing more than a decent-sized sack of gold coins.

to your attacking them, especially as they seem to have a sort of hive

are systematically crushed against what is actually not particularly rocky 
ground. The lemmings involved in the attack abruptly move in an expanding

The eastern foothills~
   Alpine flowers cover this grassy meadow in the foothills. The flood-plain 
actually does not extend quite this far north, so the forest continues in 
some degree to the west. To the south you can see a small shack.

   And then all at once the noise ceases abruptly. Anything much bigger than 
yourself gets ground against the rocks at the mouth of the cave, and 
accompanies you into the darkness as a thick red paste. Before you can decide 
what that smells like, you realize that you are completely underwater and 
shooting through a tube only a few feet wide,,,   ...

getting louder, and you fear that it will be only a matter of time before the
omnivorous beasts track you down. On the positive side of things, your eyes
have adjusted a bit better to the dark, and you can see the jagged walls of
the cavern, which contain large chunks of pure metals and gem deposits. Of
course, greed is somewhere down on your list of priorities right now...

A vortex on the dark rapids~
   The speed of the river picks up, and the walls take on an eerie light as 
some kind of natural phosphor deposits shine, revealing some fascinating 
scenes along the sides of the rapids. You briefly glimpse what is 
unmistakably a fire-newt fishing kayak, and above it past the edge of the 
river you see a small cave. You judge that you can just barely sail over the 
boat into the cavern if you jockey yourself to slide across a large flat rock 
near you -- not the most pleasant of schemes, but the cold has deadened the 
pain of recent events, and curiosity steals over you.

A waterfall in the dark rapids~
   The darkness of the tunnel abruptly ends -- perhaps prematurely -- with 
two sources of light. The brighter of the two is an amazing star-shaped 
formation in the ceiling, which lets in a dull overcast light. What's amazing 
about it is the huge pieces of cut emerald which outline the hole, and cast 
green rays of light upon the water. This almost distracts you from the fact 
that you are about ten seconds from falling towards the second source of 
light, which is several hundred feet beneath you. Unperturbed, the lemmings 
cheerfully dart up, pockmarking the light from the hole and skipping the 
actual edge of the waterfall in their dive.

juveniles it would seem, feeding on swordfish. As you brush aside dismembered 
rows of shark teeth trying not to get cut on them, you wish you had the dark

of the distance in a matter of seconds and emerge to see the bright exit from

A Bizarre Sight~
   Having let go of your bawling friend, you stand upon a small islet just to 
the north of the cave and survey the new lands to the north. The river 
continues, albeit at a much slower pace, through a chilly forested area 
dotted with gingkos and various thorny-looking weeds. Off to the distance you 
can see a pair of streams empty into the river consisting of frozen slush. 
The water-moss formations continue into the river to the north, and the 
lemmings rest on these to catch warmth from a sun which is otherwise 
completely obscured by overcast clouds elsewhere.

aback by the eastern and western edges of this hidden river valley, which
consist of sheer walls made apparently of solid ruby gems which rise at least
a mile into the clouds. This boggling display of what must be some very
powerful magic indeed causes you to wonder whether coming here and meddling
in what is behind it might not be a mistake...the view one sees now, of
course, is nothing compared to the carvings you might see close-up if you
could climb there...

   Your initial impression that these two bodies of slush were separate and 
that both emptied into the river was incorrect, as the current from the west 
is strong enough to shove the slush through the river mostly and continue 
onward to the east. The moss here seems to barely be able to take the 
punishment and remain rooted in the riverbed. Nature can be deceiving, 
however...

flailing limbs of hapless elementals cut through the air with powerful swipes 
as they sail downward into a jagged pit of rocks. Whoever built the portal

strange tubular formations which must extend hundreds of feet down. You 
wonder how you did not step in one of them and perish by now. Having moved a 
fair distance east from the river, you survey the ruby wall and see that it 
contains thousands of magnificent runic inscriptions, some of which can 
clearly be recognized by clerics and mages as alternative or precursor 
formula for spells like armor and sanctuary. Whoever built the wall

in the shape of an "X" upon a large island covered with brilliant patches of

and several hundred humanoids of various descriptions are wandering about and 
fishing on the lake. You find that either side of the lake-shore is 
accessible from this point, or you can take the risky approach and head

has been set up here, and a large magic portal for unloading cargo from 
faraway places has been set up in the northwest corner, heavily guarded. 
Everything from driders to yagnodaemons are plying their wares, as a sort of 
mercantile plaza on a dusty but otherwise flat clearing clashes with what you

crates through another portal.  Someone is apparently going to fair lengths to
disguise their trading operations as mere food shipments to the village.  In

   Here in the northeast corner of the kobold settlement stands a large field 
of mushrooms, of bright fluorescent colors unlike any you have ever seen. 
Some seem to shine with their own light in the dark, and you realize that 
several of them are carnivorous, catching fireflies in a method similar to 
that of a venus fly-trap. Female kobolds wander the field, deftly uprooting 
the mushrooms with long shear-like instruments so as not to get bitten.

The lake before the palace of the wicca~
   The warm waters of the lake seem to be naturally effervescent... across 
the bubbling surface of the water to the north you see a muddy trail rise 
around the perimeter of the island.

In a placid lake~
   The still waters of the lake are a welcome respite from the recent assault 
of cold and rapids, and you almost doze on the surface as you watch kobolds 
fish for large salmon from their boats.

In a placid lake~
   As the fishing boats become less common, so do the salmon, but a thick 
stream of bubbles emanates from the northeast...
