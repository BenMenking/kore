Entrance to the Tower~
   This room is a small extentsion to the tower, used more for simple
security than anything else. Why they woudld need sucecurity, you have no
idea, but apparently they do. You don't see anyone, but they are probably
still here. Look harder, or maybe use some flour.

A noble's hole~
   For a noble, this hole isn't so great, but by halfling standards, this
hole is wonderful. A few tapestries hang, depicting scenes of great heroism
or cataclysms. A humongous pantry is in a side room.

leads to all the other rooms in the Tower, and the portal to the west
leasds to a place not in the tower, the Bard's Guildhouse. Above you

chamber, where mages can practice thier spells.

The Mage Guildmaster Chanmbers~
    The Guildmaster of the Shire Mages himself cast a permanent "Dispel
Magicx" Spell upon this room, to protect himself. He wields a staff
given to him by the Ggod Raleon, not the god of mages, but who was pleased
by his deeds. This rooms serves as a meeting room and the private chambers
of the Guoildmaster, or Head of the Enclave of Mages.

The Spellcasting Chamber~
   Within this room, less powerful mages are casting spells at magical
targets within the room, practicing for battle. The targets absorb the
spells so no one gets hurt. A few walls a charred in spots where it
semms ems a mage missed the traget arget and hit the wall.

Entrance to the Bard's Guild~
   Off from the mages, this is the place where all the mages and in fact 
most halflings in general come to relax and enjoy themselves. In tohe room
to the north, you can hear some mages prbards practicing, and to the south you can 
hear some performing in the tavern.

The Bard's Practice rRoom~
   This is about the only place in the world you can ever hear a bard that
is out of tune. Many of them are practicing here, and some qsound quite
good, while others, well, sound like crap.

The Barding Tavern~
   Within the tavern the Bard Guildmaster sits, playing a tune on a
magical harp and lyre, given to him be the god Raleon, who was most
pleased by his barding, and decided he should be made more than
other bards where, the Master Bard. 
   The Tavern is alight with fires in fireplaces, and many guests
idly drink ale as they listen to the Master Bard's singing.

Along Westdale rRoad~
   Calming singing comes from the Tavern to the east, and prayers can be
heard off to the west, in the Church of All Gods. Halflings wander about 
on the street, doing their own thing, and you wonder just what you should
be doing.

The Entrance and Main Hall~
   Many religions are being preached here, from evil to neutral to good.
The three orders of clerics, the Black, Red, and White Proiests, have all
settled thier problems and become friend.ss. They have realized that to
have a perfect world, everything, evien comflicting forces, must be in true
harmony.

They have found harmony amongst thier fdifferences. Have you?

Near the End of Westdale Road~
   North of here the road ends at what seems to be a feeststival. Around
you halfling walk, going from jobs to houses to entertainment. What appears
to be some apartments lie to the west, and a house is to the est.ast.

A hobbit hole~
   This is the home of a simple hobbit, one who cares not for big, fancy

Apparently there is a guard to the door, and it doesn't want to let you pass.
Apparently, you're not getting through.

before you has only a few select people sitting at it, who appear to be
the closest of friends. They talk and laugh merriyly with each other, and
you feel inclined to sit down and join them.

is the bedroom. The mayor's mentally-challenged wife sits here, sewing, as
lots of guards mill about the  place, looking for thieves.

family tree is upon the eastern wall. The western wall is an off-white.

A Well Traversed Path~
   You are walking along a path that has seen quite a few travellers,
or halflings as the cast may be.  A few of them acknowledge you with
a brief nod but are otherwise silent as they enjoy the natural sounds
of the forest.  You can barely hear sounds of activities in the
distance that mark a settlement here in the forest.

The Blacksmiths Shop~
   Clang clang! The sound of a hammer hitting red hot steel repeatedly
is overwhelming. A stocky halfling stnads behind the forge, hammer in
hand. He wipes the sweat from his brow and then glances over at you,
seeing you for the first time. He lays down the hammer and walk over
to the counter.
