Within the depths of Hell.~
    As you enter the room you see a Persian carpet spread across the floor.  
Two man size candelabre stand on either side of the door, filling the room with
a moving, golden light.  The colors in the room are so bright it looks like
stained glass.  Wall hangings cover the two longest walls.  On one wall, a
unicorn fled from a pack of hounds.  The other hanging was a battle scene so
dimmed with age that parts of the figures had vanished into the cloth.  Bright
silken drapes cover the far end of the room, hung from the celing with heavy
cords.  A door is open to the left of the drapes.

seals the cemetery, preventing undead from entering or leaving. To
the east there is a sign on a door of what used to be the caretakers
house. There is no caretaker of the cemetery, now only a priest would
feel the need to attempt to make the place a bit more presentable and
to lay to rest any roaming undead creatures. Maybe you should read the
sign on the door before you enter the house.

Pier~
  There are a few people idling around waiting to unload cargo from the
ships. There are odd things that wash up on the piers here. Flotsam and
jetsam contunues to wash up, a reminder of the troubled days. At night
the entire northern bank of the Tesh is very foggy, and phamtoms of the
dead float or sail on the Tesh.

  Outside the South Tesh Gates there are closed at all times as they no

get in and out this way is due to the need for the guards to get back and
forth to the lighthouse. To the north you can see the remains of the Tesh
Bridge. To the east is a path along the wall that leads to the lighthouse.

Keep. Off to the north is the beginning of Hellspires mountains.

  As you travel off the path the fog gets thicker making it all

ruins. There is a lot of flotsam and jetsam floating around you.

Heaven and Hell.~
  As you enter the bedroom you get the faint smell of something pleasant
and resonating like expensive perfume that lingers in the room after the
wearer has gone. The walls are an off-white with thin silver, gold, and
copper designs running through it. The carpeting is black. A canopy bed
takes up most of one side of the room. Black,gauzy curtains cover the bed
making it indistinct, misty, like a dream. Black and crimson sheets cover
the bed. A black couch with blood-red pillows thrown along it is against
the fall wall. A matching love seat is against the last wall.
