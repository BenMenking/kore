Near the black pit of the Codex~
     You are in a blood red room with horrible disfigured creatures in the
walls, screaming and pleading for mercy. You feel the presence of unspeakable
evil lurking. You see the huge black pit of pure darkness. You hear spine-chilling
screams and hideous lustful laughter echoing throughout the pit.

You fall

You fall

You scream uncontrolably as you plunge to the jagged rocks below. You see
many bloody corpses and equipment scattered across the rocky floor.
Just before you hit the bottom, you feel your body being teleported.
You black out.
You awake.
You see a light coming from the north.

Heart of the Codex~
     You are in the heart of the corruption. You see mutilated corpses hanging from the
ceiling and walls. You hear the silent rattle of the chains hanging the corpses. You
hear grunting and howling noises coming closer and closer to YOU!
