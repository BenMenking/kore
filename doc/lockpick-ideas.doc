...that represent a certain kind of pick
 and then either single or double ended
 and that could work well for normal locks..
 normal locks would have a key and a difficulty number
 (or be !pick)

 another way you could have it so that locks could be opened is via
 a "harmonic" system - where you have wierd tuning forks, that make
 "sine" waves.. and you have to "ring" the lock, which gives a weird
 output and you have to match up the picks to it?  (and then a chime
 of opening makes sense)

 could you make up a "superpick"? (a key basically)
 once you've picked a lock?
 or could you make impressions from a non-magical key?
